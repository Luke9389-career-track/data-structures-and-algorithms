Steps

English description of what I need to do:
After some research, here are some functions that seem useful for this task
fs.readFileSync
fs.renameSync
stats.mtime
fs.readdirSync

1. read the file
2. save the file's contents
3. save the original file name (number)
4. find when the file was last modified
5. rename the file
6. loop through each file with steps (1-5)

Chunks (Each step from above)
