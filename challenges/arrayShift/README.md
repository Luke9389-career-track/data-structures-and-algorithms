# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
This code challenge asks that we shift a given number to the beginning of a given array. 

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach I took for this problem was to keep the solution simple. I "scooted" every element of the array back by one, and then put the given number in the zeroth index of the array.
